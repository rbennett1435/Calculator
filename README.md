# Unit6_Project

# What is this?

This project is a calculator that a friend and I made to test our JavaScript skills. The calculator has the basic functions of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Alongside those, we added in the ability to take the square root, have a number go to a entered power, and use PI in their calculations.

# Why did we do this?

We chose a calculator because we were on a deadline and did not have much time to make a big project. A calculator allows a software engineer to test their fundamental skills of JavaScript and create a simple project that can be used everyday.

# Known issues

There are a few known issues. The biggest one would be the fact that the user is forced to multiply when using PI, or when taking the square root of a number.

# Are we satisfied with this?

We are satisfied with the project despite the things we want to change. This project has proven to us that we know how to use JavaScript to maninpulate the DOM of objects.
